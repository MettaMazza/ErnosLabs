# Ern-OS

**A small operating system written entirely in plain-English Ernos.**

Ern-OS boots into its own world: its own disk, its own people and passwords,
its own folders and notes — and you talk to it in plain English. Every line
of the system is written in [Ernos](https://github.com/mettamazza), the
plain-English programming language, and the whole thing rebuilds from
nothing with only a C compiler. No cloud, no accounts, no telemetry:
everything Ern-OS knows lives inside its own `disk/` folder.

Welcome back, maria.

Made a folder called letters.
/home/maria > go to letters
You are now in /home/maria/letters.
/home/maria/letters > write a note called hello saying good morning world
Saved the note hello.
/home/maria/letters > read hello
The note hello says:
good morning world
```

## Build and boot

You need a C compiler (clang) — nothing else.

```bash
bash build_ern_os.sh      # builds the vendored Ernos compiler, then the OS
./start_ern_os            # boots into the graphical desktop (needs raylib)
./start_ern_os --terminal # a full-screen text desktop (no libraries)
./start_ern_os --plain    # or the sentence-only shell
```

For the graphical desktop, install raylib once: `brew install raylib` (or
your package manager). Without it, Ern-OS falls back to the terminal
desktop automatically — that face needs nothing at all. On Windows it is
the same, with clang and a Windows 10+ terminal — `build_ern_os.bat` then
`start_ern_os.exe`. See [docs/running_on_windows.md](https://github.com/MettaMazza/Ern-OS/blob/main/docs/running_on_windows.md).

The first boot prepares the disk and asks you to become the administrator.
The **graphical desktop** is a real window: a macOS-inspired menu and window
chrome, a Windows-inspired Start/taskbar, a live local-system sidebar, a
conversation window, and clickable app buttons. The **terminal desktop** is
the same idea drawn in text, with a live side panel that Tab flips. Every
face runs the very same plain-English commands. Say `help` inside, or read
[docs/the_command_language.md](https://github.com/MettaMazza/Ern-OS/blob/main/docs/the_command_language.md).

### First bare-metal boot

The x86_64 Phase 2 kernel now has a real freestanding boot path. With clang,
lld, GRUB rescue tools and QEMU installed:

```bash
bash build_baremetal.sh
bash tests/test_baremetal_qemu.sh
```

It boots through Multiboot2, constructs page tables, enters 64-bit long mode,
starts a COM1 terminal HAL and a 1 MiB freestanding allocator, then emits a
line from an Ernos source file compiled by the real frontend and a
machine-checked serial marker. This is the hardware foundation and first
language slice, not yet the complete Ernos shell/apps on bare metal. See
[baremetal/README.md](https://github.com/MettaMazza/Ern-OS/blob/main/baremetal/README.md).

## What it is

- **Self-contained.** Everything works offline. The whole world lives in
  `disk/`; you can read it with any file browser, and nothing ever leaves it.
- **Self-rebuilding and self-contained.** The complete OS is Ernos source.
  clang turns the frozen, compiler-generated `toolchain/epc_bootstrap.c`
  into the vendored Ernos compiler; that compiler builds Ern-OS. From inside
  the running OS an admin can rebuild and verify both the system and compiler.
- **Plain English all the way down.** The shell speaks English, and so does
  the source: the disk driver is `the_disk.ep`, the parser is
  `understand_command.ep`, and logins are checked by `verify_login`.
- **Defensive by default.** Password records use a versioned, salted,
  200,000-round SHA-256 scheme and legacy records migrate after a successful
  login. Writes are staged and atomically replaced with interrupted-write
  recovery. Every path is checked at one fence (`the_disk.ep`), members can
  change only their own home, and log-write failures are surfaced visibly.
- **Lived-in.** Several people share one machine (`add a person called
  finn`), and it ships with apps: a **notes** editor, a numbered **files**
  walker, a system **monitor**, and a first-day **welcome** tour that
  greets the very first login. `what is running` shows the services.

## How it is built

Three strict layers, one rule: **only the hal touches the host machine.**

```
userland   system/shell/   the conversation: understand, do, help
kernel     system/kernel/  folders, people, sessions, the system log
hal        system/hal/     the terminal, the disk, the clock, the machine
```

The layer rule is enforced by the test suite, and it is the road to real
hardware: host-specific access is concentrated in six HAL modules. A
bare-metal port still requires a freestanding runtime and hardware editions
of those contracts. The full design is in
[docs/how_ern_os_works.md](https://github.com/MettaMazza/Ern-OS/blob/main/docs/how_ern_os_works.md), and the bare-metal
road map in [docs/road_to_bare_metal.md](https://github.com/MettaMazza/Ern-OS/blob/main/docs/road_to_bare_metal.md).

## Tests

```bash
bash tests/run_all_tests.sh
```

Checks the layer rules, runs unit tests for the parser, layout, services,
virtual files, permissions, atomic recovery and account migration, then
boots the whole OS against scripted conversations. Persistence is proved
across a restart. Self-rebuild runs in a disposable copied worktree, twice,
and must be byte-identical; it never renames or removes the project `disk/`.
GitHub Actions defines the same full Linux job and an isolated Windows build
and smoke job, plus an x86_64 QEMU job that proves the freestanding Ernos
payload boots without host dependencies.

## The road ahead

- ~~**M1 — boot, login, shell**~~ done.
- ~~**M2 — services, apps, people**~~ done.
- ~~**M3 — the desktop**~~ done: a full-screen terminal desktop, blending
  Mac and Windows, portable to both.
- ~~**M4 — self-rebuild from within**~~ done: say `rebuild the system` and
  Ern-OS recompiles itself with its own toolchain, checks the result, and
  swaps it in — proven byte-identical across generations on every test run.
- ~~**M5 — a real graphical desktop**~~ done: a raylib window with a mouse,
  Mac-like chrome, a Windows-like Start/taskbar, live status, clickable apps,
  and the same conversation in pixels. The terminal desktop and plain shell
  remain (they need nothing).
- ~~**Stabilization**~~ done: isolated non-mutating smoke tests, atomic disk
  replacement and recovery, explicit I/O failures, versioned authentication,
  session cleanup, a real shutdown signal, internal crypto, and Linux/Windows
  CI. See [docs/stabilization.md](https://github.com/MettaMazza/Ern-OS/blob/main/docs/stabilization.md).
- **Phase 2 — bare metal (started)**: x86_64 Multiboot2 → long mode, serial
  HAL, machine HAL, bootstrap allocator and QEMU boot CI are implemented. The
  freestanding Ernos compiler/runtime, scheduler, RAM disk and full shell come
  next. See the road map.

## Taking Ern-OS with you

Everything needed travels in this one folder. To hand it to another
machine (or another person), pack it without your personal disk and the
built things:

```bash
tar --exclude='disk' --exclude='start_ern_os' --exclude='start_ern_os.previous' \
    --exclude='rebuilt_ern_os' --exclude='rebuilt_ern_os.ep' \
    --exclude='toolchain/epc' --exclude='toolchain/epc_next' --exclude='*_compiled.c' \
    --exclude='tests/tmp_run' --exclude='.git' -czf ern-os.tar.gz -C .. Ern-OS
```

On the other machine: unpack, then `bash install.sh` (or `bash install.sh
--check` to run the whole test suite first). Only clang is needed. On
Windows: `build_ern_os.bat`, then `tests\smoke_windows.bat` to verify.
